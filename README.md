## Kanban Boards Project

This project allows you to create Kanban board(s).

Deployable with Docker Composer.

## Motivation
Software Development requires coordination. Kanban is an Agile methodology that allows everyone to visualize the progress of tasks.

In order to understand what Kanban is, I created an application that would facilitate Kanban. I additionally wanted to explore Web Application technologies, which are listed in the Tech Stack.

## Tech Stack
- GraphQL
  - GraphQL Yoga (Server)
  - Apollo (UI Client)
- Database
  - Prisma
- UI
  - React Hook Form
  - Zod
- NextJS

## TODOS:
- Account functionality
- Nicer UI: Modals, Tooltips, etc.
